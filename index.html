        <h1>City in Nature, Nature to Play</h1>

        <p><strong>City in Nature</strong> is the blueprint for Singapore's future, with parks playing a crucial role. According to the Singapore Green Plan 2030, by 2030, all households will be within a 10-minute walk of a park. Additionally, by 2035, the city aims to add 1,000 hectares of green spaces, further enhancing its commitment to sustainability and urban livability.
            <br><br> 
            The <i>storymap</i> illustrates the distribution of existing park resources in Singapore, per capita park area, and the accessibility of current parks. Through this map, we can identify from a regional planning perspective which areas require more parks and how much additional park space is needed to meet the goals of the Green Plan.
            <br><br>
            We aim not only to meet the quantitative demand for parks from residents but also to improve the quality of parks so they can truly attract residents to play. 
            <br><br>
            The crowdsourcing map is designed to gather information on the parks that residents love, allowing us to understand why these parks are appealing. From a place-making perspective, this helps us enhance the quality of parks.
